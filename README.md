Proud to share my latest dashboard analyzing Adidas sales performance across multiple dimensions:

✅ Total Revenue: $120M

✅ Regional Performance: West region leading with $89M+ profit
✅ Top Retailer: West Gear ($85M+ profit)

🔍 What I used:
📌 Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts
📌 Slicers for dynamic filtering (Product, Year, Sales Method, City)

This dashboard helps visualize performance in a way that supports data-driven decision-making and highlights areas for growth.
